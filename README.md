# Better Food Values, 
Is a plugin that allows you to change the food and saturation value of every food item in Minecraft. 
It also allows you to add a damage value when eating a food, for instance with unhealthy food. 
You can make a cookie or cake deal some damage on eating.

# Commands:
* /bfv help - shows a help menu for the plugin
* /bfv reload - reloads the config files
* /bfv permissions - shows all permissions of the plugin
* /bfv info <food> - shows info about a given food item
* /bfv set <food> <setting> <value> - allows you to set a value of a certain food ingame
* /bfv get <food> <setting> - shows the value of a selected food
* /bfv version - shows the version of the plugin and displays if it's up to date
* /bfv author - shows the author of the plugin (me!)

# Permissions:
* bfv.admin - main admin permission for the plugin

Any suggestions are welcome, I'm already working on 2.0 which will contain a custom language file, a system to encourage a balanced diet and custom potion effects on eating food.
