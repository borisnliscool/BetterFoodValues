# Better Food Values
BFV is a Minecraft plugin for spigot servers that allows you to change the food and saturation value of every food item in Minecraft. 
It also allows you to add a damage value when eating a food, for instance with unhealthy food. 
You can make a cookie or cake deal some damage on eating.

Download jar file on [SpigotMC.org](https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/better-food-values.92020/)
Or on github at [releases](https://github.com/borisnliscool/BetterFoodValues/releases)

## Commands:
* /bfv help - shows a help menu for the plugin
* /bfv reload - reloads the config files
* /bfv permissions - shows all permissions of the plugin
* /bfv info <food> - shows info about a given food item
* /bfv set <food> <setting> <value> - allows you to set a value of a certain food ingame

Any suggestions are welcome, I'm already working on 2.0 which will contain a custom language file, a system to encourage a balanced diet and custom potion effects on eating food.
